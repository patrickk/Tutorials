/*
1. Constructor - Use to create a new instance of object; if we
want to create multiple tasks for example

2. Module - Bundle a group of like things together and create
a bundle of methods

3. Factories - Create these repositories for us so we don't have to
list out the requires

4. Singleton - Used to restrict an object to one instance of that object
across the application.
Remembers the last time you used it.
Hands the same instance back
